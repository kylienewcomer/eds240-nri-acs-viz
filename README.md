## Overview
This repository contains the materials for visualizing FEMA National Risk Index (NRI) data homework assignment for *EDS 240 - Data Visualization & Communication*. Materials for this assignment can be found on the [course website](https://eds-240-data-viz.github.io/). This project aims to visualize the risk index of counties in California versus across the United States.

## Data
Data for this project comes from [FEMA](https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/products-tools/national-risk-index) National Risk Index from the Resilience Analysis & Planning Tool. Risk is calculated with the follow equation: 
$$Risk = Expected Annual Loss * Community Risk Factor$$ 
$$Community Risk Factor = f(Social Vulnerability / Community Resilience)$$
